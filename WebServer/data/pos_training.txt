The ignorance here is astounding. Clearly it says in the video that Cleveland was ALREADY convicted of  and is serving jail time for it. He's GUILTY. She WAS RAPED!! (for all of the morons who've said ugly statements about her or attacked the veracity of her story) The only determination that this court is trying to make is whether Cash Money should be held liable. I think it's reasonable that when you invite someone to make a professional presentation at YOUR company that YOU provide necessary protections for that individual. I don't care whether Cleveland was employed or just ""a hanger-on"" a professional guest should not have been left unattended in the hands of someone dangerous that was there admittedly with Baby and Slim's knowledge and permission. If you went to a store and were attacked by an employee or a ""friend of the boss"" (who was permitted to hang around premises)

Whoever takes out the Heat in the playoffs will be America's Team.
Reds have.. he wasn't eected to come over and be the number he was brought over cause he has the potential to be a #1 that whole deal was basically based on potential and the Reds got the better of the deal.. Calm down no need to point out what he has done so far we all know lets talk about how to get him back to where he was so we are getting out of him what we all eected.. this team is going to the playoffs regardless of his performance it would just be nice if he contributed like he should be and i fully eect that he will pay dividends sooner rather than later

Of course Iran has been talking us to death for years in their development of nukes. \xa0 With Obama and Hillary they have willing allies to prolong it even further. \xa0 The Israelis and believe or not the Saudi's and Jordanians will not wait for Obama knowing exactly who he supports. \xa0 The Arabs have as much to lose because occupying them is also on Irans time table. \xa0 Simply put the Iranians are shiite and the Saudi's and Jordanians are sunni they hate each other deeply. \xa0 In this case Enemy of my Enemy is my friend at least for today.

I'm in two minds over this..nn nnOn the one hand stats like this will immediately provoke cries of a widening class division between the educated rich an the uneducated poor.
